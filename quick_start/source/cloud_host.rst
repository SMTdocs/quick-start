==========================================
"Cloud SaaS-Hosted" Quick Start
==========================================

Introduction
--------------

Similar to a Data-Center MSP-Hosted environment, CentreStack has a Cloud version that is readily hosted. 

This works well for managed service providers who have smaller clients here and there. Because
of the smaller number of total clients, the Data-Center MSP-Hosted overhead is relatively high. MSPs can 
use the Cloud version since it is readily deployed and ready to use.

Preparation
---------------------

Since you don't need to prepare the CentreStack server installation any more (it is hosted by CentreStack.com), 
all that you need to do is create hosted tenants. A tenant, based on business requirement,  is mapped to 

    1. a client of yours
    2. a company
    3. an organization in a bigger company
    
    
    
Create Tenant
--------------------------

You can create tenants directly from the Hosted-CentreStack.
